## ReportGen vs ReportGen 2.0

### ReportGen (Core Java Version)

ReportGen was originally developed as a console-based Core Java application as part of the academic syllabus. Later, it was enhanced with a Java Swing GUI to simulate a real desktop application.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Built using Core Java
* Initially CMD-based, later upgraded to Java Swing GUI
* Uses file handling for data storage
* Works offline without database or internet
* Focused on Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals
